#### **Our research interests include:**

###### **üñêÔ∏è Tactile Sensing and Multimodal Perception.**
We design novel tactile sensors and multimodal sensing systems (e.g., vision-tactile fusion) to equip robotic hands with human-like touch capabilities. Research spans sensor hardware development, signal processing algorithms, and applications in deformable object manipulation.

###### **üß† Embodied Intelligence and Skill Learning.**
We explore reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and tactile-guided policy optimization to enable robots to adaptively grasp, manipulate, and collaborate with humans in unstructured environments.

###### **ü§ñ Robotic Systems and Advanced End-effector Design.**
From soft robotics to dexterous manipulators, we build integrated robotic systems with an emphasis on real-world applicability. Projects include dynamic control architectures, sensorimotor coordination, and hardware-software co-design for robust robotic operations.

###### **üåê Human-robot Interaction.**
We investigate teleoperation interfaces, shared autonomy frameworks, and intuitive communication protocols to bridge human intent with robotic execution. Applications range from industrial cobots to assistive robotics for healthcare scenarios.
