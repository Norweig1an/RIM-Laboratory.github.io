## Research


Our research interests include but are not limited to:

üñêÔ∏è **Tactile Sensing and Multimodal Perception**.   
We design novel **tactile sensors** and **multimodal sensing systems** (e.g., vision-tactile fusion) to equip robotic hands with human-like touch capabilities. Research spans sensor hardware development, signal processing algorithms, and applications in deformable object manipulation.

üß† **Embodied Intelligence and Skill Learning**.   
We explore **reinforcement learning**, **imitation learning**, and **tactile-guided policy optimization** to enable robots to adaptively grasp, manipulate, and collaborate with humans in unstructured environments.

ü§ñ **Robotic Systems and Advanced End-effector Design**.  
From soft robotics to dexterous manipulators, we build **integrated robotic systems** with an emphasis on real-world applicability. Projects include dynamic control architectures, sensorimotor coordination, and hardware-software co-design for robust robotic operations.

üåê **Human-robot Interaction**.   
We investigate **teleoperation interfaces**, **shared autonomy frameworks**, and **intuitive communication protocols** to bridge human intent with robotic execution. Applications range from industrial cobots to assistive robotics for healthcare scenarios.
